## Problem 3.

A company wants to design a new type of chocolate in the form of a rectangular block of uniform material. They want the block to contain as much mass as possible; however, there are regulations concerning the block's faces for shipping considerations. One face must have an area no greater than $6 \text{ cm}^2$, another face cannot be greater than $8 \text{ cm}^2$, and the largest face cannot be greater than $12 \text{ cm}^2$. What is the greatest possible mass for a piece of chocolate?

This example could be part of a business decision-making problem. The company aims to maximize its profit but must find a suitable solution for production. Operations Research assists in decision-making, for instance, through optimization models.

In this case, defining the variables isn't even straightforward. Though not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the three edge lengths of the block—say, $x$, $y$, and $z$—are appropriate, for the following reasons. From these lengths, we can easily express the other quantities specified in the problem: $xy$, $xz$, and $yz$ are the face areas, and $xyz$ is the total volume, which is to be maximized. Note that if the chocolate is homogeneous, volume is proportional to mass, so maximizing volume is equivalent to maximizing mass. Second, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are independent of one another: selecting $x$ does not directly affect the selection of $y$, as all possible combinations can form a block. If they were not independent, additional constraints would need to be formalized. 

The most important requirement for a set of variables to be suitable for a model is that if $x$, $y$, and $z$ are given, the solution to the real-world problem is well-defined. That is, we can accurately determine whether the constraints are satisfied and what the objective value is. Now, let's express the three face area constraints and the volume objective to formulate the optimization model. Note that $x$, $y$, and $z$ should also be positive, but these bounds will be implicitly enforced by an optimal solution of the model.

$$\begin{aligned} \text{maximize} &: xyz \\ \text{subject to} &: xy \leq 6 \text{ cm}^2 \\ & xz \leq 8 \text{ cm}^2 \\ & yz \leq 12 \text{ cm}^2 \\ & x, y, z \geq 0\end{aligned}$$ (6)

There are many feasible solutions for this model; for example, $x = y = z = 2 \text{ cm}$ is feasible, but $x = y = z = 2.5 \text{ cm}$ is infeasible. There is a single optimal solution, which is $x = 2 \text{ cm}$, $y = 3 \text{ cm}$, and $z = 4 \text{ cm}$; the total volume in this case is $24 \text{ cm}^3$.

The method for finding this optimal solution and unequivocally proving its optimality is non-trivial and beyond the scope of this Tutorial. Here’s a hint, if the reader wishes to solve it: $(xyz)^2 = (xy) \cdot (xz) \cdot (yz)$.

### 2.4 Mathematical Programming

We've examined two very simple optimization problems so far. However, for the second one, we would have trouble if we had to actually solve it and prove that our solution is indeed optimal.

The key idea of mathematical programming, though, is that **we are not the ones who actually solve the models**. We are the ones who translate the real-world problem into an optimization model; then, software specifically designed for solving models typically does the heavy lifting for us. Finally, we only need to verify that the model's solution is suitable for the real-world problem.

A mathematical programming model consists of the **model variables** that represent our freedom of choice, the **constraints** that express the requirements for a solution to be feasible and suitable for the real-world problem, and finally, the **objective function**, which determines the criteria for finding the best among the feasible solutions.

Although the general concept is that we are only formulating a model, we still need to be careful about which class of model we choose. The main reason is that the class greatly affects the available solution methods. Solving a model from a more specialized class, as opposed to a more general one, can be drastically cheaper in terms of computational effort. We explicitly mention two model classes that are highly important in Operations Research.

In **Linear Programming (LP)** models, the variables can take arbitrary real values. The constraints are equations or non-strict inequalities involving **linear expressions** of the variables. A linear expression is the sum of some variables, each multiplied by a constant. Linear expressions cannot contain multiplication or division of variables with each other, or any other mathematical functions or operations: only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a constant are allowed. The objective function itself must be a linear expression of the variables, the minimization or maximization of which is the optimization goal. The following is an example of an LP problem:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{minimize} &: 3x + 4y - z \\ \text{subject to} &: 2x + 5 = z + 2 \\ & x - y \leq 0 \\ & x + y + z \leq 2 (x + y) \\ & x, y, z \geq 0\end{aligned}$$ (7)

An important point about LP models is that only non-strict constraints are allowed ($\leq$, $\geq$, or $=$), but strict constraints ($<$, $>$ ) are not. Also note that Problem 1 about Alice is formulated as an LP model, while Problem 3 about the chocolate blocks is **not** an LP, because it contains a product of variables ($xyz$), which is a nonlinear term.

An LP model is solvable in polynomial time based on the number of constraints and variables. This means large models can be formulated and solved in acceptable time using a modern computer. LP problems have several interesting properties that make them solvable with efficient algorithms, for example, the Simplex Method (see Chapter 8). One such property is that the set of feasible solutions in space is always a closed, convex set.

In **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** models, we may also require some variables to only take integer values in feasible solutions, contrary to LP problems. This difference makes solving the generally broader class of MILP models an **NP-complete problem** in the number of integer variables. This means that if there are many integer variables in an MILP model, we generally cannot expect a complete solution in an acceptable amount of computational time. However, the number of applications that MILP models can cover is surprisingly much wider than for LP problems, making MILP models a popular method for solving complex optimization problems. Effective software tools utilizing heuristic algorithms often solve non-complex MILP models very quickly.

In this manual, we focus on MILP and LP models. In both cases, only linear expressions of the variables appear in the formulations. There are other problem classes, such as Nonlinear Programming (NLP) and Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), with corresponding solvers, but these are not covered here.
