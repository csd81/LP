Problem 3.
A company wants to design a new kind of chocolate in the form of a rectangular brick of homogeneous material. They want the brick to contain as much mass as possible, however, there are
regulations on the faces of the brick, for transporting considerations. One of the faces must have an
area not greater than 6 cm2 , another face cannot be greater than 8 cm2 , and the largest face cannot
be greater than 12 cm2 . What is the largest mass for a piece of chocolate?
This example can be part of a business decision problem. The company wants to maximize its
profit, but has to find a suitable solution for production. Operations Research helps in decision
making, for example, with optimization models.
Now it is not even straightforward to define the variables themselves. Though not even mentioned
in the problem text, the three edges of the brick, say x, y and z are adequate, for the following
reasons. From these we can easily express the other quantities the problem specification refers to:
xy, xz and yz are the faces, and xyz is for the total volume which is to be maximized. Note that if
the chocolate is homogeneous, then volume is proportional to mass, so we may consider maximizing
volume instead of mass, they are equivalent. Second, x, y and z are independent of each other: the
selection of x does not directly affect the selection of y, as all possible combinations can yield a
brick. If they were not independent, additional constraints must have been formalized.
The most important thing is that if x, y and z are given, then the solution to the real-world
problem is well-defined. That means, we can exactly tell whether the constraints are satisfied or
not, and what the objective value is. This is the most important requirement for a set of variables

to be adequate for a model. Now let us do this work: express the three constraints for the faces and
the objective of the volume to formulate the optimization model. Note that x, y and z should also
be positive, but these bounds will be implicitly enforced by an optimal solution of the model.
maximize :
subject to :

xyz
xy ≤ 6 cm2
xz ≤ 8 cm2
yz ≤ 12 cm2
x, y, z ≥ 0

There are many feasible solutions for this model, for example x = y = z = 2 cm is a feasible one,
but x = y = z = 2.5 cm is an infeasible one. There is a single optimal solution, which is x = 2 cm,
y = 3 cm and z = 4 cm, the total volume in this case is 24 cm3 .
The way of finding this optimal solution and undoubtedly prove that it is indeed optimal, is
not trivial, and is out of scope of this Tutorial. There is a hint, if the reader liked to solve it:
2
(xyz) = xy · xz · yz.

Mathematical programming

We have seen two very simple optimization problems so far, however, for the latter one we would
have been in trouble if we had to actually solve it and prove that our solution is indeed optimal.
However, the point of mathematical programming is that we are not the ones who actually
solve the models. We are the ones who translate the real-world problem to an optimization model,
then usually a software designed generally for solving models is doing the dirty job for us. Finally,
we only need to verify that the solution of the model is actually a suitable solution to the real-world
problem.
A mathematical programming model consists of the model variables that represent our freedom
of choosing solutions, the constraints that express the requirements for a solution to be feasible,
and correspondingly, suitable in the real-world problem, and finally the objective function, which
determines the criteria of finding the best among the feasible solutions.
Although the general idea is that we are only formulating a model, we still need to take care
about what class of model we choose. The main reason is that it greatly affects what kind of solution
methods we can use. Solving a model from a more special class in contrast with a more general
one can be drastically cheaper in terms of computational effort. We explicitly mention two model
classes that are of great importance in Operations Research.
In Linear Programming (LP) models, the variables can take arbitrary real values. The constraints are equations or non-strict inequalities of linear expressions of the variables. A linear
expression is the sum of some of the variables, each multiplied by a constant. Linear expressions
cannot contain multiplication, division of the variables with each other, or any other mathematical
functions or operations: only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a constant is allowed.
The objective function itself must be a linear expression of the variables, the minimization or maximization of which is the optimization goal. The following is an example of an LP problem.
minimize : 3x + 4y − z
subject to : 2x + 5 = z + 2
x−y ≤0
x + y + z ≤ 2 (x + y)
x, y, z ≥ 0

One important thing about LP models is that only non-strict constraints are allowed (≤, ≥ or
=), but strict constraints (<, >) are not. Also note that Problem 1 about Alice is formulated as an

LP model, while Problem 3 about the chocolate bricks is not LP, because it contains a product of
variables, which is a nonlinear term.
An LP model is solvable in polynomial time in the number of constraints and variables. That
means, large models can be formulated and solved in acceptable time with a modern computer. LP
problems have several interesting properties that make them solvable with efficient algorithms, for
example, the Simplex Method (see Chapter 8). One of such properties is that the set of feasible
solutions in space is always a closed, convex set.
In Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models, we may additionally restrict some variables
to only take integer values in feasible solutions, contrary to LP problems. This difference makes
solving generally the wider class of MILP models an NP-complete problem in the number of integer
variables. That means, if there are many integer variables in an MILP model, then we generally
cannot expect a complete solution in acceptable computational time. However, the number of
applications the class of MILP models can cover is surprisingly more extended than for LP problems,
making MILP models a popular method for solving complex optimization problems. There are
effective software tools utilizing heuristic algorithms that usually solve not too complex MILP models
very fast.
In this manual, we focus on MILP and LP models. In both cases, there are only linear expressions
of the variables appearing in the formulations. There are other problem classes like Nonlinear
Programming (NLP), Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), with corresponding solvers,
but these are not covered here.
