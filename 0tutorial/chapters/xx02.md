Alice’s train leaves 75 minutes from now. She lives 8 km away from the station and plans to walk, and she also needs 30 minutes to get ready. Furthermore, she cannot average a speed faster than $\frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. How fast must she walk to the station to catch the train?

$$\begin{aligned} \text{minimize} &: x \\ \text{subject to} &: 30 \text{ min} + \frac{8 \text{ km}}{x} \leq 75 \text{ min} \\ & x \leq \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}\end{aligned}$$ (5)

In rare cases, a model may be **unbounded**. This means that feasible solutions exist, but none of them are optimal, because there are always better and better feasible solutions available. For example, if Alice’s goal was to go as fast as possible to catch a train, instead of as slow as possible, then neither $\frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, $\frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, $\frac{1000 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, nor the speed of light would be optimal solutions, because there would always be a feasible solution with a higher speed value. Of course, this scenario is nonsensical. Typically, when our model turns out to be unbounded, we either made a mistake in solving it, or it does not accurately describe reality—perhaps because it omits some real-world constraint we overlooked. The latter was the case in our example, because, in practice, Alice cannot walk as fast as she wishes.

We can also call the set of feasible solutions of the model the **search space**, emphasizing that our actual goal in optimization is to maximize or minimize an objective function value over the set of feasible solutions. If all the variables are treated together as a mathematical vector, each solution can be considered a point in that vector space. The set of all feasible solutions is a set of points in space that may have special properties. For instance, in LP problems, it is a convex polytope. Constraints (and bounds) are used to define the search space. Each constraint may exclude some values, making them no longer feasible within the search space.

It may appear that a constraint does not exclude any solutions from the search space at all. We call those constraints **redundant**. Note that redundant constraints do not affect the model's solutions and therefore do not change the optimal solution, but they might affect the solution procedure itself, either positively or negatively. We may also refer to constraints as redundant if they do exclude some solutions, but only those that are not interesting to us (for example, because they cannot be optimal for some reason and will not be reported by the solution algorithm anyway).

Now, let's look at a slightly more elaborate example of an optimization problem.
