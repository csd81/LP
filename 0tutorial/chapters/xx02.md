Problem 2.
Alice’s train departures 75 minutes from now. She lives 8 km away from the station and wants
to walk, and also needs 30 minutes to get ready. Also, she cannot run faster than 10 km
h in average.
How fast shall she walk to the station to catch the train?

In rare cases, it may appear that a model is unbounded. This means that there are feasible
solutions but none of them are optimal, because there are even better and better feasible solutions
as well. For example, if the goal for Alice was to go as fast as possible to catch a train, instead of
km
km
being as slow as possible, then neither 4 km
h , 10 h , 1000 h or the speed of light would be optimal
solutions, because there would always be a feasible solution with higher speed value. Of course, this
does not make sense. Usually, when our model turns out to be unbounded, then we either made a
mistake in solving it, or it does not describe reality well – maybe because it misses some real-world
constraint we did not thought about. The latter was the case in our example, because in practice,
Alice cannot go as fast as she wishes.
We can also call the set of feasible solutions of the model as the search space, emphasizing that
our actual goal in optimization is to maximize or minimize an objective function value over the set of
feasible solutions. Also, if all the variables together are treated as a mathematical vector, then each
solution can be considered a point in that vector space. The set of all feasible solutions is a set of
points in space that might have some special properties. For example, in LP problems, it is a convex
polytope. Constraints (and bounds) are used to define the search space. Each constraints might
exclude some feasible values from the search space that are no longer feasible anymore because of
that constraint.
It may appear that there is a constraint that does not exclude solutions from the search space
at all. We call those constraints redundant. Note that redundant constraints do not affect the
solutions of the model, and hence the optimal solution, but may affect the solution procedure itself,
either in a positive or a negative way. We may also refer to constraints as redundant if they do
actually exclude some solutions, but only those which are not interesting for us (for example, because
they cannot be optimal for some reason and therefore will not be reported by the solution algorithm
anyways).
Now see a bit more elaborate example for an optimization problem.
