Optimization
2.1

Equations

Equations are one of the easiest and strongest mathematical modeling tools we have. Let’s see an
example problem that can be solved by an equation.
 
Problem 1.
Alice’s train departures 75 minutes from now. She lives 3 km away from the station and wants
to walk, but she and also needs 30 minutes to get ready. How fast shall she walk to the station to
catch the train?
We can see that what we actually seek is the minimal average speed Alice have to move with.
She can be faster at some points of her walk, or slower, but overall, the average speed counts,
determining when she will arrive. She can even go with constant speed to achieve the same result.
Also, we seek to find the minimal speed, with which she just catches the train. Of course, she can be
even faster, then she will have some waiting time at the station. These steps may be trivial, but are
also part of the modeling procedure: we simplified the problem into finding a single minimal speed
value and we may assume that Alice goes with that constant speed, and just catches the train.
The problem can be solved by expressing the time until she arrives to the station in two different
ways. Once, the time she arrives is 75 min, by the train schedule. On the other hand, the time she
arrives is 30 min for getting ready, plus the time she walks. The latter term is something which is
not known, it depends on Alice’s speed. Now, we introduce a variable x to express Alice’s speed,
which is in question. Variable x is some value that can be chosen, that Alice has freedom upon. She
can choose her speed in order to arrive to the station sooner or later.
With x, we can express the time she spends walking easily by 3 km
x . Now an equation can be
formulated based on the fact that Alice’s arriving time is expressed in two different ways.
3 km
= 75 min

x
The task for Alice is to choose an appropriate x so that this equation holds. From this point, the
equation is formulated, we can forget the real-world problem and apply our mathematical knowledge
about solving equations. This is an easy one. We can, for example, subtract 45 minutes from both
sides, multiply by x (which, we can assume not to be zero), then dividing by 3 km, in that order.
We arrive to the following.

2.2. FINDING THE „BEST” SOLUTION

OPTIMIZATION

What we actually do by solving an equation is transforming it to easier forms so that the next
form is a direct consequence of the previous. The final form is x = 4 km
h , which literally means the
following: „If 30 min + 3 km
=
75
min,
then
its
direct
consequence
is
x = 4 km
x
h ”. So, if Alice just
km
catches the train, then her average speed is 4 h And at this point we finally got the result and
interpreted it in the reality. This is the general way on how equations are used in problem solving.
First, we identify the freedom we have at the problem to be solved (x, the speed). Then, we use
equations, as modeling tools to express the rules of reality that must be obeyed (the first equation).
The model is now ready, we apply our solution techniques which can be quite general for any kinds
of equations and have nothing to do with the underlying real-world problems. In this case, the
equation is transformed in a chain of direct consequences until the variable is expressed directly as
a constant value. Finally, if the result is obtained for the mathematical model, we interpret it as
the solution of our initial real-world problem.
Of course, there are much more difficult examples of equation solving (for example, multiple
solutions for single equations, fake solutions, multiple variables, multiple equations at the same
time, etc.), which are not covered here. But the point is that the scheme is similar each time: we
formulate a mathematical model that describes the real-world situation, solve that model with some
well-known general techniques and then interpret the solution of the model as the solution of the
original problem.

2.2

Finding the „Best” solution

Note that the question about Alice catching the train in Problem 1 was how fast she can go to catch
km
km
the train. The answer was x = 4 km
h , but that is not totally correct. Actually, x = 5 h , x = 10 h
km
km
or even x = 15 h are solutions as well for her, if she can run that fast. However x = 3 h is not
a solution, as she will miss the train if she is that slow. Of course, for this particular problem, we
understand that there is a minimum speed of x = 4 km
h , for which Alice just catches the train in
time. However, the more precise formulation would be the following inequality instead.
3 km
≤ 75 min
(3)
x
Two quantities are here: the time Alice needs to reach the station if her speed is x, that is,
30 min + 3 km
x , and the time the train departs, 75 min. These two quantities are related: Alice must
arrive before or exactly when the train is due (not later, in other words). This can be expressed as
an inequality rather than an equation, but the goal is the same. We must find a speed for Alice x
for which the inequality holds. Technically, this can be done exactly the same way as the equation
itself was solved, leading to x ≥ 4 km
h . That means that the solutions are actually all x speeds that
are at least 4 km
.
There
are
infinitely
many solutions for the inequality, so infinitely many speeds
h
Alice can choose.
Now this is more precise, but Alice may be interested in the minimum speed she can choose, so
let x be as small as possible. The formulation is as follows.
30 min +

minimize : x
subject to : 30 min + 3 km
x ≤ 75 min

(4)

At this point, the formulated problem is an optimization problem. The goal is not only finding
one suitable solution for a real-world problem, but finding the most suitable one in some aspect.
In the mathematical point of view, optimization is not only finding a solution for an equation,
inequality, or a set of such, but finding the best. Optimization is a sub-field of Operations Research,
as it is an inevitable way of supporting business decisions: given a complex real-world situation,
what shall be the best response?

2.3

OPTIMIZATION

Main concepts

Now that we have seen some optimization from Problem 1, it is time to establish some basic concepts
of optimization models.
When solving a real-world problem by defining some variables, equations, inequalities, etc. we
formulate a mathematical model for the problem. That model is then solved with mathematical
knowledge, that is usually independent of the original, real-world problem. If the solution procedure
is made by some software (usually the case), that software is called a solver.
There are variables in an optimization model. These represent our freedom of choice: the way
the variable can take different values represent our different actions. In Problem 1, there is a single
variable, x representing Alice’s average speed.
A solution of an optimization model is when all the variables take some value. If there are
multiple variables in the model, then a single solution consists of values for all of these variables.
Two solutions are considered different if any of the variables take a different value. In Problem 1,
km
km
there are infinitely many solutions, like x = 4 km
h , x = 10 h , and moreover, x = 1 h as well (see
below), although Alice misses the train.
Usually the variables cannot take arbitrary values. In Problem 1, Alice cannot choose a speed if
she would miss the train with it. Such restrictions that must apply, are called constraints. So in
the example problem, there is a single constraint, which is expressed by Inequality 3.
There are a wide range of constraints that may appear in an optimization problem, some cannot
even be expressed as inequalities. The concept of bounds shall be mentioned: these are constraints
that require a single variable to be not less than, or not more than a given constant limit. For
example, x ≥ 0 km
h is a bound that must also be ensured. The problem required Alice to move
with a positive speed, so it was implicitly enforced and neglected. In many optimization problems,
however, we must explicitly consider bounds, otherwise solutions might not reflect reality. Bounds
also have a great practical importance in model solution algorithms.
Constraints decide whether solutions are feasible or infeasible. A feasible solution is when all
variables take a value for which all the constraints hold. Otherwise, it is an infeasible solution. In
km
km
Problem 1, solutions x = 4 km
h and x = 10 h are feasible, while x = 1 h is infeasible. We could
km
km
also say that, literally, x = 4 h is a solution and x = 1 h is not a solution, but we rather use the
terminology of feasible and infeasible solutions.
The way we distinguish feasible solutions of a model so that whether they are more or less suitable, is expressed in the model as an objective function, which is to be minimized (or maximized).
An objective function - like constraints - evaluates an expression based on the model variables. The
goal of optimization is to find a feasible solution for which the objective function is minimal (or
maximal). A solution with this property is an optimal solution of the model. If a solution is
optimal, then we can be sure that any other solutions are either infeasible, have an equal or worse
objective value, or both. There can be multiple optimal solutions for the same model. In Problem
1, we have a very simple objective function c(x) = x, which is minimal at the solution of x = 4 km
h .
The optimal objective for the problem is therefore 4 km
.
Sometimes
we
refer
to
the
objective
value
h
as the solution of an optimization problem. Therefore, we can say that the optimal solution of
Problem 1 is 4 km
h .
It may happen that an optimization model does not have a feasible solution at all, hence there
are no optimal solutions either. In this case, we say the model is infeasible. For example, the
following modification of the problem (see Problem 2), the resulting System 5 would be infeasible:
Alice is too far away and cannot go fast enough, she will miss the train by 3 min at least.
