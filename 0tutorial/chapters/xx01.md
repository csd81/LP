### 2.1 Equations

Equations are one of the simplest and most powerful mathematical modeling tools we have. Let's look at an example problem that can be solved using an equation.

**Problem 1.**
Alice's train leaves 75 minutes from now. She lives 3 km away from the station and plans to walk, but she also needs 30 minutes to get ready. How fast must she walk to the station to catch the train?

We can see that we are actually looking for the minimal average speed Alice must maintain. She might walk faster at some points or slower at others, but the overall average speed determines her arrival time. She could even walk at a constant speed to achieve the same result. We are also seeking the minimal speed with which she *just* catches the train. Of course, she could walk faster and have some waiting time at the station. These steps may seem trivial, but they are part of the modeling process: we have simplified the problem to finding a single minimal speed value and can assume that Alice walks at that constant speed, arriving precisely on time.

The problem can be solved by expressing the time until she reaches the station in two different ways. First, her arrival time is 75 minutes, based on the train schedule. Second, her arrival time is the 30 minutes needed for preparation plus the time spent walking. The walking time is the unknown term, as it depends on Alice's speed. We now introduce a variable $x$ to represent Alice's speed, which is what we need to find. Variable $x$ is a value that can be chosen, giving Alice control over the outcome. She can choose her speed to arrive at the station sooner or later.

Using $x$, we can easily express the time she spends walking as $\frac{3 \text{ km}}{x}$. Now, an equation can be formulated based on the fact that Alice's arrival time is expressed in two different ways.

$$30 \text{ min} + \frac{3 \text{ km}}{x} = 75 \text{ min}$$ (1)

Alice's task is to choose an appropriate $x$ so that this equation holds true. From this point, the equation is formulated, and we can set aside the real-world problem and apply our mathematical knowledge about solving equations. This is an easy one. We can, for example, subtract 30 minutes from both sides, multiply by $x$ (which we can assume is not zero), and then divide by 3 km, in that order. We arrive at the following:

$$x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$$ (2)

### 2.2 Finding the "Best" Solution

What we actually do when solving an equation is transform it into simpler forms, where each subsequent form is a direct consequence of the previous one. The final form is $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, which literally means: "If $30 \text{ min} + \frac{3 \text{ km}}{x} = 75 \text{ min}$, then its direct consequence is $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$." So, if Alice is to just catch the train, her average speed must be $\frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. At this point, we have the result and can interpret it in reality. This is the general way equations are used in problem-solving. First, we identify the degree of freedom we have in the problem ($x$, the speed). Then, we use equations as modeling tools to express the rules of reality that must be followed (the first equation). The model is now ready; we apply our solution techniques, which are typically general for all types of equations and have nothing to do with the underlying real-world problem. In this case, the equation is transformed in a chain of direct consequences until the variable is expressed directly as a constant value. Finally, once the result for the mathematical model is obtained, we interpret it as the solution to our initial real-world problem.

Of course, there are much more difficult examples of equation solving (for example, multiple solutions for single equations, extraneous solutions, multiple variables, systems of multiple equations, etc.), which are not covered here. But the point is that the scheme is always similar: we formulate a mathematical model that describes the real-world situation, solve that model with some well-known general techniques, and then interpret the model's solution as the solution to the original problem.

### 2.3 Main Concepts

Note that the question about Alice catching the train in Problem 1 was about how fast she *must* go. The answer was $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, but that is not entirely accurate. In reality, $x = \frac{5 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, $x = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, or even $x = \frac{15 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ are also solutions for her, assuming she can walk that fast. However, $x = \frac{3 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ is not a solution, as she would miss the train if she were that slow. Of course, for this particular problem, we understand there is a minimum speed of $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ for which Alice just makes the train on time. However, the more precise formulation would be the following inequality instead:

$$30 \text{ min} + \frac{3 \text{ km}}{x} \leq 75 \text{ min}$$ (3)

Two quantities are compared here: the time Alice needs to reach the station if her speed is $x$ (which is $30 \text{ min} + \frac{3 \text{ km}}{x}$) and the time the train departs (75 min). These two quantities are related: Alice must arrive at or before the train is due (in other words, no later). This can be expressed as an inequality rather than an equation, but the goal is the same. We must find a speed $x$ for Alice for which the inequality holds. Technically, this can be solved in exactly the same way the equation was solved, leading to $x \geq \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. This means the solutions are actually all speeds $x$ that are at least $\frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. There are infinitely many solutions for the inequality, meaning Alice can choose from infinitely many speeds.

Now, this is more precise, but Alice may be interested in the minimum speed she can choose, so let $x$ be as small as possible. The formulation is as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} \text{minimize} &: x \\ \text{subject to} &: 30 \text{ min} + \frac{3 \text{ km}}{x} \leq 75 \text{ min}\end{aligned}$$ (4)

At this point, the formulated problem is an **optimization problem**. The goal is not only to find a suitable solution for a real-world problem but to find the **most suitable** one in some specific aspect. From a mathematical perspective, optimization involves finding the *best* solution, not just *a* solution, for an equation, inequality, or a set of such statements. Optimization is a sub-field of Operations Research, as it is an essential way to support business decisions: given a complex real-world situation, what is the best course of action?

### 2.3 Main Concepts

Now that we have seen some optimization from Problem 1, it is time to establish some basic concepts of optimization models.

When solving a real-world problem by defining variables, equations, inequalities, and so on, we formulate a **mathematical model** for the problem. That model is then solved using mathematical knowledge that is usually independent of the original, real-world problem. If the solution procedure is carried out by software (which is usually the case), that software is called a **solver**.

An optimization model contains **variables**. These represent our freedom of choice: the different values a variable can take represent our different potential actions. In Problem 1, there is a single variable, $x$, representing Alice's average speed.

A **solution** to an optimization model is when all the variables are assigned a value. If the model has multiple variables, a single solution consists of values for all of those variables. Two solutions are considered different if any of the variables take a different value. In Problem 1, there are infinitely many solutions, such as $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, $x = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$, and even $x = \frac{1 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ (see below), though in the latter case Alice misses the train.

Usually, the variables cannot take arbitrary values. In Problem 1, Alice cannot choose a speed if she would miss the train with it. Such mandatory restrictions are called **constraints**. So, in the example problem, there is a single constraint, which is expressed by Inequality (3).

A wide range of constraints may appear in an optimization problem; some cannot even be expressed as inequalities. The concept of **bounds** should be mentioned: these are constraints that require a single variable to be no less than or no more than a given constant limit. For example, $x \geq \frac{0 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ is a bound that must also be enforced. The problem required Alice to move at a positive speed, so this was implicitly enforced and not explicitly stated. In many optimization problems, however, we must explicitly consider bounds; otherwise, solutions might not reflect reality. Bounds also have great practical importance in model solution algorithms.

Constraints determine whether solutions are **feasible** or **infeasible**. A feasible solution is one where all variables take values for which all the constraints hold true. Otherwise, it is an infeasible solution. In Problem 1, solutions $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ and $x = \frac{10 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ are feasible, while $x = \frac{1 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ is infeasible. We could also say that $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ is a solution and $x = \frac{1 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$ is not a solution, but we prefer the terminology of feasible and infeasible solutions.

The way we differentiate between feasible solutions of a model—determining which ones are more or less suitable—is expressed in the model as an **objective function**, which is to be minimized (or maximized). An objective function, like constraints, evaluates an expression based on the model variables. The goal of optimization is to find a feasible solution for which the objective function is minimal (or maximal). A solution with this property is an **optimal solution** of the model. If a solution is optimal, we can be sure that any other solutions are either infeasible, have an equal or worse objective value, or both. There can be multiple optimal solutions for the same model. In Problem 1, we have a very simple objective function, $c(x) = x$, which is minimal at the solution $x = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. The optimal objective for the problem is therefore $\frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$. Sometimes, we refer to the objective value as the solution of an optimization problem. Therefore, we can say that the optimal solution to Problem 1 is $\frac{4 \text{ km}}{\text{h}}$.

It may happen that an optimization model does not have a feasible solution at all, and thus, there are no optimal solutions either. In this case, we say the model is **infeasible**. For example, the following modification of the problem (Problem 2), the resulting System (5) would be infeasible: Alice is too far away and cannot go fast enough; she will miss the train by at least 3 minutes.
