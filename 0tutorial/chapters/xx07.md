## Problem 6.

Append a sixth equation, $x + y + z + w + v = 0$, to Problem 5 and solve it.

Now that we have the complete model, Problem 6 can be implemented in a single data section. A new element, `Eq6`, is added to the set `Equations`, and the corresponding RHS and coefficients are also introduced. Note that the original model and data section format is used, where parameters `Rhs` and `Coef` are not merged.

```
data;
set UnknownValues := x y z w v;
set Equations := Eq1 Eq2 Eq3 Eq4 Eq5 Eq6;
param Rhs :=
Eq1 -5
Eq2 -5
Eq3 1.5
Eq4 0
Eq5 -0.5
Eq6 0
;
param Coef: x y z w v :=
Eq1 4 -2 3 . .
Eq2 . . -1 -1 .
Eq3 . 1 1 . .
Eq4 4 -7 . 2 5
Eq5 1 . 2 . 3
Eq6 1 1 1 1 1
;
end;
```

We already know the original solution for Problem 5 with the system of just the first five equations: $x = 2$, $y = 3.5$, $z = -2$, $w = 7$, and $v = 0.5$. This literally means that the first five equations imply that the sum $x+y+z+w+v$ equals $2 + 3.5 + (-2) + 7 + 0.5 = 11$. The result, $11$, contradicts the sixth equation, $x + y + z + w + v = 0$, in Problem 6. In short, if the first five equations hold true, the sixth cannot. Not surprisingly, the overspecified model turns out to be **infeasible**.

Here is the solver output:

However, there is still an interesting question when faced with an overspecified system of equations: Instead of finding a perfect solution, can we find a solution for which the error in the equations is kept **minimal**? More precisely, the **maximum of the errors**.
