Problem 6.
Append a sixth equation x + y + z + w + v = 0 to Problem 5 mentioned in previous sections and
solve it.
Now having the complete model, Problem 6 can be implemented in a single data section. A new
element Eq6 is added to the set Equations, and the corresponding RHS and coefficients are also
introduced. Note that the original model and data section format is used, where parameters Rhs
and Coef are not merged.

We already know the original solution for Problem 5 with the system of just the first five
equations, it is x = 2, y = 3.5, z = −2, w = 7, v = 0.5. This literally means that the first five
equations imply that the values of the five variables are as mentioned. That means x+y +z +w+v =
11 is also implied which contradicts the sixth equation x + y + z + w + v = 0 in Problem 6. In short,
if the first five equations hold, then the sixth cannot. Not surprisingly, the overspecified model turns
out to be infeasible.

However there is still an interesting question if we are faced an overspecified system of equations.
Instead of finding a perfect solution, find a solution for which the error at the equations is kept
minimal. More precisely, the maximum of errors.
