Problem 33.
    Solve Problem 21, the general transportation problem with centers, with the following problem data. There are four supplies, named S1 to S4, two centers, C1 and C2, and six demands, named D1 to D6. Transportation costs, available amounts for supplies, and required amounts for demands are summarized in the following table.

    | | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 | D5 | D6 |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | C1 | 5 | 10 | 3 | 10 | 10 | 3 | 9 | 8 | 1 | 6 |
    | C2 | 10 | 2 | 7 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 3 | 2 | 7 | 8 |
    | Amounts | 100 | 250 | 190 | 210 | 120 | 140 | 170 | 90 | 110 | 120 |

    Two scenarios must be evaluated.
    * In the first, „small” establishment cost scenario, using C1 and C2 require a fixed cost of 1200 and 1400, respectively.
    * In the second, „large” establishment cost scenario, fixed costs are multiplied by 10, e.g. 12000 and 14000, respectively.
