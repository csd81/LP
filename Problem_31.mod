Problem 31.
    Solve Problem 22, the originally proposed transportation problem, with flexible demands added. There is a surplus and a shortage penalty constant. The penalty for each demand is calculated by multiplying the difference of actual transported materials and the requirement, by a corresponding penalty constant. There are two different scenarios to be evaluated.
    * The shortage penalty constant is 3, and the surplus penalty constant is 1. This is the „small” penalty scenario.
    * The shortage penalty constant is 15, and the surplus penalty constant is 10. This is the „large” penalty scenario.
