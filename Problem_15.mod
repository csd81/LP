Problem 15.
    Given a set of food types, and a set of nutrients. Each food consists of a given, fixed ratio of the nutrients. We aim to arrange a diet, which is any combination of the set of food types, in any amounts. However, for each nutrient, there is a minimum requirement that the diet must satisfy in order to be healthy. Also, each food has its own proportional cost. Find the healthy diet with the lowest total cost of food involved.
