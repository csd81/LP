Problem 21.
    Given a single material, a set of supply points, and a set of demand points. Each supply point has a nonnegative availability, and each demand point has a nonnegative requirement for the material. The material can be transported from supply point to any demand point, in any amounts. The unit cost for transportation is known for each such pair. Find the transportation amounts so that the following holds:
    * Available amounts at supply points are not exceeded.
    * Required amounts at demand nodes are satisfied.
    * The total transportation cost is minimal.
