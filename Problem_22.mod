Problem 22.
    There are four supplies named S1 to S4 and six demands named D1 to D6. The amount of available materials at each supply, required materials at each demand, and unit transportation costs between each pair of a supply and a demand, are all summarized in the following table.

    | | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 | D5 | D6 | Available |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | S1 | 5 | 10 | 3 | 9 | 5 | 12 | 100 |
    | S2 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 250 |
    | S3 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 6 | 4 | 8 | 190 |
    | S4 | 9 | 10 | 6 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 210 |
    | Required | 120 | 140 | 170 | 90 | 110 | 120 | |

    (Numbers in the last row and column refer to material amounts, elsewhere numbers refer to costs per amount of material transported.) Transport materials from the supplies to the demands to satisfy requirements at minimal cost.
