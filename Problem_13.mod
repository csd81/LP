Problem 13.
    Solve the production problem, but now instead of optimizing for revenue, optimize for profit. The profit is the difference between total revenue from products, and total costs of raw materials consumed for production. The cost for each raw material is proportional to the material consumed, and is independent of which product it is used for. A single unit cost for each raw material is given.
