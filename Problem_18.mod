Problem 18.
    Solve Problem 14, the original production problem, where data are exactly the same, but there are two other options for production.
    * P1 and P2 can be produced jointly, with slightly different consumption amounts than separately. Producing one unit of both products requires 240 units of raw material A (instead of 250 when done separately), 200 units of raw material B (instead of 205 when done separately), 4400 units of raw material C (slightly more than 4200 when done separately), and 2 units of raw material D (exactly as if done separately).
    * Similarly, P2 and P3 can also be produced jointly. The costs are 51 units of raw material A (slightly more than 50 when done separately), 250 units of raw material B (instead of 255 when done separately), and 5400 units of raw material C (instead of 5500 when done separately), and 2 units of raw material D (exactly as if done separately).
